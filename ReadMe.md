# Pystykorva

- A C++ library containing Grep-like functionality
	- Made using vanilla C++ and ICU

## Design principles

- I use PIMPL idiom a lot, because I want to hide ICU from the library headers

## TODO:

- Finish the CLI code reporting
- Finish text replacing
- Port to CMake
- Consider using vcpkg with the project
